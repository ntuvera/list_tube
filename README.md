Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project. Explain your concept and data model. What problem are you solving?! Add your list of resources (what gems and APIs are you using?), research, and documentation links to this file.


Scope: I want to build an app that shares videos directly between users.  The important aspect of the app is that it tracks the sender and receiver of the video, and I want it to present a graphical representation of how each video traveled, similar to a family tree type diagram.  It will be able to send, receieve, track videos shared between users.  I'm not sure how it can be accomplished in my time frame, but it seems doable.
